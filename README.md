## Why did I Build this? 

The other day, I was using my favorite 3d software, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), when I realized how strange it was for me to be interacting a 3d object on a 2d screen. 
How do we so convincingly display that? I had to figure it out, so I built a little script using Python and PyGame. Is it efficient? No. Does it solve issues with existing programs? Hard no. 
Did  I learn a lot making it? Yes. And you can too. I'll explain everything to the best of my ability on [medium](https://medium.com/@hudbeard/3d-projection-from-scratch-in-pygame-in-200-lines-of-code-39b1b81a3a22).
